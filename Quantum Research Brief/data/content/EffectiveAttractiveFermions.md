Finding exact solutions for systems of interacting spin-1/2 fermions has not been done yet; therefore, physicists use approximations to describe these systems. In a recent paper by T. G. Backert et al. [^1], they describe a system of strongly attractive spin-1/2 fermions by providing an effective model where two fermions of opposite spin form bosonic bound states called dimers.

They consider a system of trapped spin-imbalanced fermions. In their effective model, the degrees of freedom are now the dimers and the unpaired fermions. They begin by making use of the Bethe ansatz for the corresponding few-body problem. This allows them to write the effective Hamiltonian describing their system since they now have a description of effective interactions between the effective degrees of freedom. They later map this strongly interacting effective problem to a weakly interacting problem, which permits them to use perturbation theory to solve this system.

Their effective theory agrees with the low-energy physics of the original strongly interacting system. The validity of their theory is verified by comparing its predictions with exact numerical solutions of the initial Hamiltonian in the few-body case. Therefore, we can see the power that this novel effective theory yields since numerically solving big systems is not possible because the Hilbert space grows exponentially. This is precisely where this effective description comes to our aid.
